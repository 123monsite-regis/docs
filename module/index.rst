*************************************


PrestaShop is a very powerful e-commerce platform, and part of its power lies in the fact that it is very easy to build upon and expand through modules and overriding code.

PrestaShop is written mostly in PHP. Other languages used throughout are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the Smarty templating language, SQL, and XML. It uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC)-like pattern for its software architecture. Additionally, it uses technologies such as jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, etc.

In this guide, you will find all the necessary information to customize PrestaShop with code.
