Setting up your local environment
****************

Now that you intend to building a theme for PrestaShop, you are better off keeping all your development work on your machine. The main advantage is that it makes it possible for you to entirely bypass the process of uploading your files on your online server in order to test your changes. Another advantage is that a local test environment enables you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store. Having a local environment is the essential first step in the path of web development.

Installing PrestaShop
=====================

We advise you to install PrestaShop using the `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ and `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`_ tools.
For this, you must `download Composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`_ and `download Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_ (`which contains npm <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node>`_), and install them.

Then, open a command line on your (empty) working directory, then:

1. git clone https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop.git
2. composer install
3. npm install

Building your .gitignore file
=============================

A gitignore file is a must-have for any Git-versioned project, as it specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

What to ignore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, you shouldnâ€™t version the following types of files:

* Temporary files (such as cache files)
* Generated files (such as minified CSS or retrieved XML files)
* Files with credentials or personal information (such as ``settings.inc.php``)

In addition, we recommend to keep Core files in your versioning system.

Our own .gitignore file is here: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/.gitignore

We suggest that you build your own using http://gitignore.io/ 

Create your theme from the Starter Theme
========================================

Download the Starter Theme, or clone its repo (https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme.git)

Create your theme.yml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you need to rename ``config/theme.dist.yml`` to ``config/theme.yml`` and edit it according to your theme's name.

  name: YOUR_THEME_DIRECTORY_NAME
  display_name: YOUR THEME NAME
  version: 1.0.0
  author:
    name: "PrestaShop Team"
    email: "pub@prestashop.com"
    url: "http://www.prestashop.com"
  
  meta:
    compatibility:
        from: 1.7.0.0
        to: ~

Manage your assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Starter Theme contains the development files in the _dev folder. Install the dependencies using npm: ``cd _dev + npm install``.

Now the dependencies are installed and correctly set up, you can customise theses files.

If you need to add image files, you can create and /img folder in the /_dev folder.

Since stylesheets and JavaScript files are compiled and minified, you should use npm to build new version of theses files after your modifications: it will check for any file change, and will update the production version used by PrestaShop (localized in your assets folder).

To watch your file changes with npm, type this: ``npm run watch``.

Note: You should probably start by removing all existing styles.
