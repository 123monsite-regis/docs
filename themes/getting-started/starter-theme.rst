Starter Theme
****************


For pretty much every CMS, the default theme is used as a framework to build theme.

This means all theme are tied to most of our technical choices. if we use bootstrap it's hard to
use foundation for instance.

We decided to build a theme that will let you start your theme with all the minimum code: template files, markup ad JavaScript.

The Starter Theme is not opinionated, there is no decision made to use either this lib or another one.

If you download the release of StarterTheme, everything is ready for you.

If you clone the StarterTheme repo you will see he startertheme as some minimalistic (ugly ?) style. This is only for deelopement purpose. You shouldnt use them or inlcude them in your theme, please delete all files inside `_dev/css` (see screenshot)

[WARNING]
Unless your remove it, jQuery is loaded inside core.js


[NOTE]
Please note that if you want to sell your theme on addons, there are some specific requirements, like you must use bootstrap.

Modify. don't override.
============================

When you want to create a new theme, copy and paste all files from the starter theme inside your empty theme directory.
then start modifying it.

Do not use it as a parent theme, you will only run into trouble and waste your time.
